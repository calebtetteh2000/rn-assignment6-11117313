## HomeScreen
This is a React Native component that renders a header section for a mobile application. The header consists of two main parts: a top section with a logo and a search icon, and a bottom section with a checkout text and a bottom line image. The component uses React Native's built-in View, Image, and Text components, and defines a set of styles using the StyleSheet API to control the layout and appearance of the header elements.

# Clothes Section
The Clothes component displays a list of products in a grid layout. Each product is represented by a ProductCard component, which displays the product's image, name, description, price, and an "Add to cart" button. The products are stored in an array and mapped to individual ProductCard components.

The OurStory component displays a title "OUR STORY" and two circular images with a list view and a filter icon.
